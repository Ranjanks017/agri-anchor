                <p>Cacti (plural for cactus) are a family of plants that are well adapted to hot, dry environments.</p>
                <p><b>Family</b>: Cactaceae</p>
                <p><b>Native Habitat</b>: Mostly native to the Americas, particularly to regions with desert climates, although a few species can be found in other parts of the world.</p>
                <p><b>Structure</b>: Cacti are typically succulents, meaning they store water in their stems. This gives them their distinctive, often thick and fleshy appearance.</p>
                <p><b>Spines</b>: Most cacti have spines, which are modified leaves. These spines provide protection against herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
                <p><b>Flowers</b>: Cacti are known for their large, showy flowers, which can be quite colorful. Their blooms often appear in spring or summer and are usually quite short-lived.</p>
                <p><b>Roots</b>: Cacti often have shallow, wide root systems designed to absorb water quickly after rainfall.</p>
